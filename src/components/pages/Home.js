      My name is Jim Clark and I'm currently work as an SEO specialist at an agency in New Hampshire. Day by day, I've been learning web development and Javascript at the University of New Hampshire. I'm mostly finding ways to enhance my SEO skills by increasing my understanding of fundamental coding.
